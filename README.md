# animation-practice
Some practice with animation using framer-motion library in react

The simple app uses a fetch to get data from an open API using this URL: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users'

Other than that, there's no database for this at the moment.

If you'd like to test this yourself to see how the animations are working, you just have to install your dependencies, and run the app:

Install dependencies with npm:

```
npm install
```

Run the app:

```
npm run dev
```
